YouTubeDownloader is a CLI based script, that is capable to download high quality content from Youtube.
To work property it require installed ffmpeg and a chunk of RAM memory.

Memory usage is highly dependent on video quality - here are some references:
 400 MB of RAM when processing FULL HD 30 FPS video,
 1.4 GB of RAM when processing 4K 60 FPS video,

Currently supported output file formats are *.mp3 (encoded using MP3 codec, stores only audio content),
*.opus (encoded using Opus codec, stores only audio content) and *.webm (stores both video and audio
encoded using VP9 and Opus codecs respectively).

Keep in mind that processing long, high quality videos may take a long time to finish.
"""


class YouTubeVideo:
    """
    Class meant to be used as downloader of high quality/resolution content present on YouTube.

    To work properly it requires pytube module (developed on version 15.0.0)
    along with ffmpeg (developed on version 4.3.6-0+deb11u1). Should be launched preferably in Linux-based systems.

    When dealing with high-resolution videos (i.e. 4K 60 FPS) it is recommended to have available at least 1.4 GB
    of free RAM memory - it will be needed to process them using ffmpeg.
    Otherwise, ffmpeg runtime will end up with 'out of memory' error.

    Memory usage for typical FULL HD 30 FPS video osculates around 400 MB.

    Above memory values were trial-determined on Debian 11.7.0, that used 4 core CPU
    and maybe different in other operating systems and hardware configurations.
